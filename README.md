## Info
**Team Name** stdafx

**Team Members** Corbin G, _~~Angelo, JJ I~~_

**Grade** Sophomore

**Project Details** This is a Hackathon Simulation RPG Game.  It uses an algorithm to generate [Arenas]() from a **`Collection`** of Custom Enemies.  This **`Collection`** is completely expandable such that:
```
// Number of Enemies               (N)
// Number of Enemy Tasks (Weapons) (W)
// Time (ms)                       (T)
   1 ≤ N ≤ 1,000,000,000
   1 ≤ W ≤ 1,000,000,000
   0 ≤ T ≤ 5,000
```
**Specifications**
* Framework Constructed from Scratch
* Dynamic Algorithm for generating Arenas
* Dynamic Algorithm for generating Enemies
* Dynamic Algorithm for Searching Enemies
* Interactive Game
* Ability to Adapt

**Language**
* Java
* (Ran out of time to convert to C++)

## Humor
### Joke of the Day
How long can I go without sleeping?

_**Update [6:00PM 11/13/21]():** Final Submission Posted.  Updating README.md.  I got maybe 2 hours of sleep during this entire thing._

## Config

### See Instructions in [EXECUTE]()

**Download** Clone git repository to local drive. 
**Execute** Type in command in terminal or [Run Executable]()
* **Windows:** Run executable or `HackerS.exe <command>` I think
* **Mac OS:** `open HackerS.out` or `./HackerS.out` idk you choose
* **Linux:** `./HackerS.out` or just use an actual OS

_That wasn't too hard now, was it?_

## About The Team
### Corbin
_**Why stdafx?** C++ was my first language and my pride and joy,_
_the greatest ongoing joke I had between myself and fellow C++ users was forgetting `#include <stdafx.h>` in a cpp file and the whole thing doesn't work!_
* The app is supposed to be running on C++ (the joke is I haven't used it in 8 years because it is so time consuming).
* I'm writing the algorithms in java and then copying them over because it compiles faster and is easier to test.
* If I run out of time I might not be able to get it to C++ but the joke stands becasue I tried.
